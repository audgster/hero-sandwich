Instructions on how to build program from source:

1. Using your command line utility, navigate to directory ~/hero-sandwich/src where the ~ represents the parent directory in which you placed hero-sandwich.

2. Run "javac @sources.txt" to compile all the .java files to .class files

3. Run "java GameWindow" to run the game

Troubleshooting:

Should you encounter errors, try running "find. -name *.java > sources.txt" before step 2
